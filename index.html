Endemic to Africa, it is usually found in the open grasslands and savannah of the sub-Saharan region. Although a member of the order Accipitriformes, which also includes many other diurnal raptors such as kites, hawks, vultures, and harriers, it is given its own family, Sagittariidae.</p>

		">In 1769 Vosmaer was the first European to describe the Secretary Bird in one of the pamphlets later collected as his Regnum Animale, naming it Sagittarius for its gait which was thought to resemble an archer's. He also mentioned that it was known as the Secretarius by farmers at the Cape of Good Hope who had domesticated it to combat pests around homesteads. In 1779 English illustrator John Frederick Miller also described it as secretarybird,[3] and it was soon after assigned to its own genus Sagittarius by French naturalist Johann Hermann in his Tabula Affinitatum Animalium.</p>

      <p class="section2content1" style="font-family: 'Raleway', sans-serif;"><img src="images/Secretary_Bird_with_open_beak1.jpg" class="img3" alt="Secretary Bird With Open Beak">Unlike most birds of prey, the secretarybird hunts its prey on foot. Adults hunt in pairs and sometimes as family flocks. They stalk through the grass with long strides. Prey includes insects, mammals from mice to hares and mongoose, crabs, lizards, snakes, tortoises, young birds, bird eggs, and sometimes dead animals killed in grass or bushfires. The generic name Sagittarius is Latin for "archer", perhaps likening the secretary bird's "quills" to a quiver of arrows, and the specific epithet serpentarius recalls the bird's skill as a hunter of reptiles.</p>
      <p class="section2content1" style="font-family: 'Raleway', sans-serif;">The bird is famous for hunting snakes. It even hunts venomous cobras and other reptiles. Its claws are weak and blunt, so to make a kill, it stomps on its victim, breaking its back. It is put in its own family on the basis of molecular sequence analysis. Standing up, the secretarybird is nearly 4.5 feet (1.3 m) tall. ts common name is popularly thought to derive from the crest of long quill-like feathers, lending the bird the appearance of a secretary with quill pens tucked behind their ear, as was once common practice. A more recent hypothesis is that "secretary" is borrowed from a French corruption of the Arabic saqr-et-tair or "hunter-bird".</p>
